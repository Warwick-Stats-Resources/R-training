# git {background-color="#552D62"}

## Version Control

When developing code, we often want to keep old versions.

We might save with different files names
```
code                               
  ¦--simulations.R                  
  ¦--simulations_correct_sd.R       
  ¦--simulations_return_parameters.R
```  
or comment on changes (especially when collaborating with others)
```{r, eval = FALSE}
## EK 2023-01-10 use geom_bar instead of geom_histogram
## p <- p + geom_histogram(stat = "identity")
p <- p + geom_bar(stat = "identity")
## HT 2023-01-09 remove legend from plot
p <- p + theme(legend.position = "none")
```
Either way it can get messy and hard to track/revert changes!


## git

git is a version control system that allows us to record changes made to files in a _repository_ or _repo_.

Each version has a unique ID and metadata:

 - Who created the new version
 - A short description of changes made
 - When the version was made
 
Versions can be compared, restored and merged.

# {#git-protection data-menu-title="Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan quote" background-image="../images/github_wickham_bryan_git_quote.png" background-size="contain"}

## git repository

To get started, a repository must be created locally (within a working directory on your computer) or on a remote hosting platform (we'll use GitHub).

git can then track when files/folders are 

   - Added
   - Modified
   - Deleted
   
Repositories can have multiple _branches_ of development. We will work on a single branch, with the default name of `main`.  

## Staging and committing

Versions are created in a _commit_.

We prepare the commit by _staging_ changes we want to record:

 * _Untracked_ files (git treats the whole content as new)
 * _Tracked_ files that have been modified or deleted since the last commit
 
Think of it like taking photographs: we stage the scene by adding/removing people, or changing people's outfits, when we have a scene we want to save we take a photograph.

## git + Github

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
The full power comes by connecting a local repo to GitHub. 

 - You can make changes locally and _push_ them to GitHub
 - You can make changes via the GitHub website and later _pull_ them into your local copy.
 - Collaborators can also push/pull changes to the repo.

# Configuring git and GitHub {background-color="#552D62"}

## Using git locally

Check if you already have git by running the following command in a terminal (e.g. Terminal tab on RStudio).

On MacOS/Linux (or Windows with Rtools)
```{sh, eval = FALSE}
which git
```

On Windows

```{sh, eval = FALSE}
where git
```

MacOS: If asked to install the Xcode command line tools, say yes - this will install git.

## Installing git

Windows: 

 - Use the installer from <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
 - Check RStudio can find the git executable
 
     - Go to Tools > Global Options > Git/SVN to check
     - Restart RStudio before trying to use git
     
Linux:
```{sh, eval = FALSE}
sudo apt-get install git
```
or
```{sh, eval = FALSE}
sudo yum install git
```

## Configure git (globally)

Set the default name and email to associate with your git commits:

```r
library(usethis)
use_git_config(
  user.name = "Ada Lovelace",     # your full name
  user.email = "ada@example.com"  # email associated with GitHub account
  )
```

To keep your email private:

   - Go to <https://github.com/settings/emails>, select “Keep my email address private” and “Block command line pushes that expose my email” options
   - Configure git to use the address provided of the form <ID+username@users.noreply.github.com>
   
## Authentication

GitHub requires authentication with a Personal Access Token or SSH key.

| SSH keys                | PAT                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------|
| More setup (on Windows) | **usethis** helpers |
| Once per computer+host  | Renew every 30 days (recommended) |
| Need for HPC            | Need for **usethis**/other R packages |

Recommend: PAT now (easier), SSH later if needed

## Main recommendations

From {usethis} vignette [Managing Git(Hub) Credentials](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html):

Our main recommendations are:

  - Adopt HTTPS as your Git transport protocol.
  - Turn on two-factor authentication for your GitHub account.
  - Use a personal access token (PAT) for all Git remote operations from the command line or from R.
  - Allow tools to store and retrieve your credentials from the Git credential store. If you have previously set your GitHub PAT in .Renviron, stop doing that.

*Highly recommend reading this entire vignette and following all guidance*

## sitrep and vaccinate

```{r}
#| eval: false

library(usethis) # make sure > v2.0.0
git_sitrep() # current situation report
git_vaccinate() # add files to global .gitignore (best practice)
```

## Get a personal access token (PAT)

First, make sure you're signed into GitHub. Then run

```{r}
#| eval: false
usethis::create_github_token()
```

- Add Note describing use-case (e.g. personal-macbook-pro-2021, project-xyz)
- Select expiration (recommend default 30 days)
- Check scope
- Click 'Generate Token'
- **Important!** Copy token to clipboard, do not close window until stored!
- You may want to store token in a secure vault, like 1Password

## Put your PAT into the local Git credential store

Assume token is on your clipboard

```{r}
#| eval: false
gitcreds::gitcreds_set()
```

- If you don't have a PAT stored, will prompt you to enter: paste!
- If you do, you will be given a choice to keep/replace/see the password
  - choose as appropriate
  - if replacing, paste!
  
## PAT maintenance

- By default token will expire after 30 days.
- Return to <https://github.com/settings/tokens> and click on its *Note*
  - or else click on link in e-mail telling you token is about to expire!
- Regenerate token
- rerun `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()`

A bit of a pain to do this every month, but only takes a couple of minutes.

## Your turn!

If you need to, generate and store a PAT, as described over last few slides and in the [vignette](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/git-credentials.html).

If you already have a PAT set, read the vignette and follow through on other best pracice recommendations.

## Create an RStudio project from a GitHub repo

Now you can clone your GitHub repo locally.

- Go to your repo homepage on GitHub. Click the green "Code" button, copy the HTTPS address (of the form `https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git`).

- In RStudio, go to File > New Project… > Version Control > Git.

  - Enter the repo URL you just copied. The project directory name will be filled automatically.
  - Browse to a location you want the project directory to be created.
  - Click `Create Project`.

## Git tab

A Git tab is added to the pane that is in the top right by default, usually with Environment, History, and Connections tabs.

The initial view is equivalent to the output of the terminal command `git status`. 

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
We can *stage* changes to commit

![](../images/stage_changes.png)
Underlying command:  
`git add <file/folder>`.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Then *commit* a set of changes

![](../images/commit_changes.png)
Underlying command:  
`git commit -m "commit message"`
:::

::::

## .gitignore

At this stage you should see two untracked files in your Git Pane that were created when setting up the project: an `.Rproj` file and a `.gitignore` file.

The `.gitignore` file specifies files that git should ignore - they won't appear in the git pane even as untracked files. 

Examples of how to specify files in `.gitignore`:

- Single file: `.Rhistory`
- File pattern: `*.log` (all files with `.log` extension)
- Directory (and files in it): `/dirname/`

The `.gitignore` file must at least be staged to have an effect.

## First commit from RStudio

- Stage and commit the `.Rproj` file and `.gitignore` file, with the message "setup RStudio project".

- Click on the clock icon in the Git pane to view the history of previous commits. 

- Close the "Review Changes" window. Now click the green up arrow to push your changes to GitHub.

- Go to the repo on GitHub and verify your changes have been pushed.

## Pulling changes from GitHub

- Edit the README once more on GitHub in a new commit.

- Back in RStudio, on the Git tab, click the blue down arrow to *pull* the changes from GitHub

- The changes to README should now appear in your local copy

## Avoid conflicts

If you work on both the local and GitHub copy, it's possible to get out of sync and end up with conflicting versions of the same file.

It *is* possible to fix this, but it can be tricky/confusing. It's best to avoid problem in first place!

Recommended practice:

- Always commit and push changes at the end of an RStudio session
- Always pull changes at the beginning of an RStudio session

## Set `.Rprofile` to check git status

This is a neat trick (credit: Lisa De Bruine)

Open your `.Rprofile`
```r
usethis::edit_r_profile()
```
and add the following (credit: Lisa De Bruine)
```r
cat(cli::col_blue(system("git status -u no", TRUE)))
```
This will run `git status` from the command line when you start R, giving a (blue coloured!) message e.g.
```
On branch main Your branch is behind 'origin/main' by 1 commit,
and can be fast-forwarded.   (use "git pull" to update your  
local branch)  nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

If your main branch is behind the main branch on _origin_ (GitHub), you should pull changes before making new edits.

## Advanced: Amend commit (before pushing)

Sometimes we don't stage everything we intended to include in a commit, e.g. we committed a file before saving the latest changes.

If we haven't yet pushed the commit to GitHub, simply stage the extra commits and check the "Amend previous commit" box under the commit message. 

The original commit message will be shown - you can edit this to change the message for the amended commit (useful if you forgot to reference a GitHub issue number)

## Advanced: Undo last commit (before pushing)

Alternatively, you can undo a commit before pushing.

To undo the commit, keeping files as they are
```{sh, eval = FALSE}
git reset HEAD~1
```
(change the 1 to a higher number to go back more than 1 commit).

To undo the commit *and all the changes in that commit*
```{sh, eval = FALSE}
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
This goes back to the version at the last commit. 

## Advanced: Undo last commit (after pushing)

It is best practice to create a new commit that undoes the changes. Run
```{sh, eval = FALSE}
git revert HEAD
```
This edits the files to undo the changes in your last commit. You should then commit these edits, with a relevant message.

It is possible to use `git reset --hard` to undo a commit and then `git push origin main --force` to force this change onto GitHub. Sometimes repository maintainers do not allow this as it rewrites the history, which can cause problems for people that have cloned or forked your repo.

## General workflow

* Commit regularly, once you've got a small complete change, e.g. a working draft of a function, a bug fix, a draft of a README.

  - It is easier to review/revert changes if they relate to a single file or common issue
 
 - Ideally, make a commit everytime you make a substantial, coherent set of changes.
 
 - At least make a commit every time you take a break, especially when leaving at the end of your working session

* Push often enough that GitHub is a useful backup
 

## Adding an existing project to GitHub

The simplest approach is to create a GitHub repo with just a README as before, create the corresponding RStudio project, copy your files into the new directory, stage and commit them.

If you are already using git and want to move the project to GitHub, see [Adding a local repository to GitHub using git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#adding-a-local-repository-to-github-using-git). Once the project is on GitHub you can clone it into an RStudio project.

## Some other tools

- [gert](https://docs.ropensci.org/gert/) R package has functions for interacting with git

- It can be worth using dedicated software for interacting with git/GitHub

  - [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
  
  - [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com)

## Summary

- Working openly encourages good practices

- Your code/software is an asset!

- We can make steps to improve our own practice

- git and GitHub are invaluable resources for version control and collaboration
